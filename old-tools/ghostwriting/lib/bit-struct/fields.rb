    #
    #   class Sub < BitStruct

    #
    #   class A < BitStruct

    # Expressed in terms of the examples above:
    #
    #   # This fails to set x in a.
    #   a.n.x = 3
    #   p a  # ==> #<A n=#<Sub x=0>>
    #
    #   # This works
    #   n = a.n
    #   n.x = 3
    #   a.n = n
    #   p a  # ==> #<A n=#<Sub x=3>>
