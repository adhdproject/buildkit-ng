# buildkit-ng
The builkit-ng installation utility replicates much of the functionality
of the [ADHD project](https://adhdproject.github.io/#!index.md)
by installing many of the tools in it.

## Requirements
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (64 bit)

## Functionality
Installing with `-g` will cuase the installer to use a terminal gui
 (whiptail) instead of a text based installer. 
### Install
`./scripts/adhd-install.sh -i [-g]`
### Uninstall
`./scripts/adhd-install.sh -u [-g]`
